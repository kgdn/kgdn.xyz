# Introduction

NAWFY (Not Another Word From You) is a social media platform where users can only post one word at a time. This project was developed in under 3 days as a part of a mini-hackathon with my friend, [James McLean](https://www.jmcl.xyz/). While we didn't manage to create a fully functional platform in that time, we did manage to create a working back-end API that could be used to create the platform in the future.

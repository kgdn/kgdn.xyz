# Introduction

For my third year group project at Heriot-Watt University, I worked with a team of 5 other students to develop a social media app called Scrap & Trace. The app was designed to be a digital scrapbooking platform where users could create and share scrapbooks with friends and family. The front-end of the app was developed using React Native, while the back-end was developed using the Django REST framework.

# Introduction

For my third year group project at Heriot-Watt University, I worked with a team of 5 other students to develop a social media app called Scrap & Trace. In this instance, I was responsible for developing the website for the company that owned the app. The website was developed using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with the Jekyll (Ruby) static site generator.
